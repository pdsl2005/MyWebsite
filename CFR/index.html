<h3>Counterfactual Regret Minimization</h3>
<p>CFR is a defensive play algorithm that learns by playing vs. itself. It starts with random strategy, and iterates
 to reach optimal Nash Equilibrium strategy. We'll start by defining counterfactual, regret, and minimization.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Counterfactual: Refers to the opposite of what actually happened. For the statement "I forgot a portable charger
    and my phone died," the counterfactual statement would be "If I'd had a portable charger, my phone wouldn't have died."
        CFR assigns a "score" for the counterfact, based on the move taken, vs what would have happened had you taken the counterfactual move.
    </li>
    <li>Regret: Refers to the different outcomes between a made decision and an optimal ones. It attempts to measure how
    much one should regret having taken an action. CFR assigns a "score" for the regret, solely based on the outcomes of the move one made, vs the
    optimal move.</li>
    <li>Minimzation: Refers to the attempts taken to minimize the regret; in other words, attempts to bridge the gap between the made move and the optimal move.</li>
</ul>
