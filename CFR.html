<h3>Counterfactual Regret Minimization</h3>
<p>CFR is a defensive play algorithm that learns by playing vs. itself. It starts with random strategy, and iterates
 to reach optimal Nash Equilibrium strategy. We'll start by defining counterfactual, regret, and minimization.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Counterfactual: Refers to the opposite of what actually happened. For the statement "I forgot a portable charger
    and my phone died," the counterfactual statement would be "If I'd had a portable charger, my phone wouldn't have died."
    </li>
    <li>Regret: Refers to the different outcomes between a made decision and an optimal ones. E</li>
</ul>
